Hello, I'm Raghav Kuppan. I currently live in Hyderabad. Until recently I used to live in Bangalore and work as a Software Engineer at Zeta, a Technology Service Provider for Banks.  

I love to read about technology in my free time and am a big fan of Rust. In my free time, I like to work on side projects in Rust, listen to music (Carnatic, Tamil film music, Hip-Hop, Alternative Rock), read books (sci-fi, non-fiction), and watch movies (English and Tamil).
